This project is my Open Source code repository. I will put all my code and script to this repository, so that others can download if found useful.

Some of my code:
  * pgen - a password generator using python
  * po-list - a script to list po files that only have untranslated or fuzzy
  * maybank-gia-rate - web scraper to get the latest Gold Investment Account price using BeautifulSoup
